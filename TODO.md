# Todo

* Make it easier to save animations locally
* More documentation on the individual functions---particularly the simulation.
* Include a picture of the trays/dryers in the README file
* Loop the README.md GIF indefinitely (not possible in RGL?).


# Features

* Convert animations to other formats?
