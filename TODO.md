# Todo

* Make it easier to save animations locally

* More documentation on the individual functions---particularly the simulation.

* Include a picture of the trays/dryers in the README file

* Loop the README.md GIF indefinitely (not possible in RGL?).

  (This may be harder than it sounds.  It appears that RGL doesn't do looping.
  `magick::image_animate` won't loop either, if called on an existing animated
  GIF.  I may have to pull together the animation directly from the raw image
  files...)

# Features

* Convert animations to other formats?
